# RAG Engineering - Retrieval Augmented Generation

## What You'll Learn

1. **RAG Architecture** - Document loading, chunking, retrieval
2. **RAG vs Fine-tuning** - When to use each approach
3. **Advanced Retrieval** - Re-ranking, query expansion, hybrid search
4. **Production RAG** - Caching, monitoring, evaluation

## Key Concepts

- Chunking strategies (fixed, semantic, recursive)
- Vector databases (Chroma, FAISS, Pinecone)
- Re-ranking with cross-encoders
- RAG evaluation metrics (context relevance, answer faithfulness)

## Real-World Scenarios

- Customer support chatbots with knowledge bases
- Document Q&A systems
- Code search and documentation
- Legal/medical document retrieval
