# Model Optimization - Quantization, LoRA, QLoRA

## What You'll Learn

1. **Quantization** - 4-bit, 8-bit model compression
2. **LoRA** - Low-Rank Adaptation for efficient fine-tuning
3. **QLoRA** - Quantized LoRA for memory-efficient training
4. **Adapters** - Modular fine-tuning approaches

## Key Concepts

- INT8, INT4, FP16 quantization
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
- Memory optimization techniques
- Inference speed vs accuracy tradeoffs

## Real-World Scenarios

- Run 70B models on consumer GPUs
- Fine-tune models with limited compute
- Deploy models on edge devices
- Reduce API costs with smaller models
