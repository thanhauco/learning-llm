# Systems Thinking - Latency, Caching, Rate Limiting

## What You'll Learn

1. **Latency & Throughput** - Optimize response times
2. **Caching Strategies** - Semantic cache, result cache
3. **Rate Limiting** - Handle API limits gracefully
4. **Load Balancing** - Distribute requests efficiently

## Key Concepts

- P50, P95, P99 latency metrics
- Cache hit rates and TTL strategies
- Token bucket and sliding window algorithms
- Request batching and streaming

## Real-World Scenarios

- Serve 1000s of concurrent users
- Stay within API rate limits
- Reduce costs with caching
- Handle traffic spikes
